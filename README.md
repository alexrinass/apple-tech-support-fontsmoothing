# Fontsmoothing broken in Layer Backed Source List View?

Example Xcode project demonstrating a standard Source List view from Interface Builder, layer backed by enabling “Full Size Content View” window. 

On both Retina and Non-Retina the Source List Text Fields do not have Fontsmoothing enabled.

Using an extra Visual Effects view around the Source List results in Fontsmoothing.

Tested on macOS 10.13.
